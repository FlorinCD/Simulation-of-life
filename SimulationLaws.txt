GRASS
	The grass energy is 15 points

PREY
	borned prey has 30 energy points (the mother loses 30 points at birth)
	prey can reproduce itself at energy >= 40
	prey can evolve at energy >= 80 (evolves in a evolved prey but loses 40 points)
	range view for searching food is 15 squares
	
EVOLVED_PREY
	reproduces by creating a normal prey if it has the enerygy >= 300 (loses 15*6 energy)
	if its energy is <= 10 (tired) it gains 0.5 every time iteration otherwise it starts searching for food
	range view for searching food is 15 squares

PREDATOR
	borned predator has 50 energy points
	if its energy is <= 10 (tired) it gains 0.5 every time iteration otherwise it starts searching for food
	if its energy is >= 120 it can reproduce itself
	if its energy is >= 150 it can evolve into an evolved predator
	it eats the prey without 30 points (standard PREY ENERGY)
	view range for searching food is 20 squares

EVOLVED PREDATOR
	if its energy is <= 30 (tired) it gains 0.25 every time iteration otherwise it starts searching for food
	if energy level >= 200 it reproduces to an evolved predator and loses 3 * 30 energy
	it eats normal prey or normal predator and receive its energy - 15
	range view for searching is huge == 50 squares

The chances | the parameters do no reflect entirely the whole mechanism since there are laws that encapsulate these chances.

Parameters to try:
    preys: 6
    predators: 2
    prey_ev_ch: 0.35
    predator_ev_ch: 0.8
    ev_pre_regress_ch: 0.001 (predator_ev_regress_ch should be very low to control the population of normal predators)
    cataclysm_ch: 0.0017 (chance of cataclysm should be small as for terrain structures to form because of ev prey and for population of predators to not go extinct)
